Relational databases and SQL servers have been a cornerstone of businesses for decades, and as data growth increases at an exponential pace, learning to work with data held in SQL Server databases is more important than ever. In this course, Jess Pomfret introduces Transact-SQL, an extension of SQL used to interact with relational databases that includes additional programming constructs and features beyond standard SQL, particularly procedural programming.
Jess starts with the basics, guiding you through your first SELECT statement to help you get the data you need out of a database. She then shows how to add functionality to help filter, manipulate, and present the results you need. By the end of this course, youâ€™ll be well equipped to write the T-SQL you need to get the job done.


 
This course includes Code Challenges powered by CoderPad. Code Challenges are interactive coding exercises with real-time feedback, so you can get hands-on coding practice alongside the course content to advance your programming skills.
